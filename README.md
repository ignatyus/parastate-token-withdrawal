# ParaState Token Withdrawal

This script lets you withdraw your STATE tokens from the ParaState Staking Contract (0xcf331422cc488882c7be03eff8b1f3b7683f26b8).

# Usage

Install **live-server**:
    `npm install -g live-server`

Run it:
    `npx live-server`

Open the server in the browser in which you have your MetaMask installed. The rest is straightforward.

MetaMask should display a warning about high gas fees.

Use it at your own risk.
